# ARTI-308
In this lab, I explored the fundamentals of version control using Git and the hosting platform GitHub. I learned how to track changes in my projects and how to use a centralized repository for collaboration.
Steps Taken to Create My Account:
Account Sign-up: I visited github.com and clicked on "Sign up".
Information Entry: I entered my email address, created a strong password, and chose a unique username.
Verification: I completed the "Launch code" verification sent to my email.
Profile Setup: I skipped the personalization steps to go directly to my dashboard.
Repository Creation: I created my first repository by clicking "New", giving it a name, and initializing it with this README file.
